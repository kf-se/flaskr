Hi, 

In this repo you'll find a python webapp built with the Flask web framework. The app is hosted on the cloud platform Heroku and is connected to a Postgre database. 

The app consists of a blog which you can register to and create posts. You can update/delete your own and upvote others. As you make a post a simple machine learning model will ingest your post body and create a sentiment based on the content. This sentiment is added to the post title.

This is a learning project for me so I have not been too concerned with robustness, clean code or performance. 

Please enjoy!

Kind regards
KF
